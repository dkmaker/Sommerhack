The goal for this project is to show off the capabilites of claude code - and what proppre planning does when using AI for coding how to achive acurate results - make a update to the README about this just brief - i want to illustrate tat with how agents does all the work for me to make a todo list application - how it works with just a simple prompt and how it will work and look if i have dedicated small agents that handle the whole development process
