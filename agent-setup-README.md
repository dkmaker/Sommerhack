     - Best practices for MVP development
   
2. **Project Management Phase**
   - Use project-manager agent to create Linear project
   - Generate 5 MVP-focused issues
   - Get project tracking established

3. **Development Phase**
   - Use tech-enforcer agent to:
     - Set up TypeScript + Express backend on port 80
     - Configure React + shadcn/ui frontend
     - Implement core functionality from requirements
   
4. **Validation Phase**
   - Use mvp-validator agent to:
     - Remove any scope creep
     - Ensure MVP criteria are met
     - Validate it's deployment ready

5. **Deployment Phase**
   - Use azure-deployer agent to:
     - Deploy to Azure Web App

     - Add run instructions

</workflow>

<output>
Final deliverables:
- Working application URL
- Linear project with 5 issues
- documentation.md file
- Research findings in docs/search/
</output>

<focus>
Keep everything simple and MVP-focused. This is a demo.
</focus>
```

## Key Differences from Direct Prompting

### Direct Prompt Approach
- **Tech Stack:** AI chooses randomly (could be anything)
- **Research:** No systematic research or documentation
- **Deployment:** Usually skipped or incomplete
- **Documentation:** Minimal, scattered, or missing
- **Project Management:** No tracking or structure
- **Scope:** Often over-engineered or misses requirements

### Agent-Based Approach  
- **Tech Stack:** Enforced TypeScript + Express + shadcn/ui
- **Research:** Perplexity-powered research with saved findings
- **Deployment:** Guaranteed Azure deployment with URL
- **Documentation:** Single comprehensive documentation.md
- **Project Management:** Linear project with 5 tracked issues
- **Scope:** MVP-validated to prevent feature creep

## Expected Outcomes

The agent-based approach delivers:
1. **Working application** at http://[app-name].azurewebsites.net
2. **Linear project** with 5 MVP issues tracked
3. **documentation.md** with all essential information
4. **Research findings** saved in docs/search/
5. **Consistent tech stack** every single time
6. **MVP-focused scope** without bloat

## Why Agents Win

- **Consistency:** Same stack, same structure, every time
- **Completeness:** All aspects covered (research, dev, deploy, docs)
- **Focus:** MVP validator prevents scope creep
- **Knowledge:** Research saved for future reference
- **Delivery:** Actually deployed and accessible, not just code

## Setup Instructions

1. **Configure Linear MCP:**
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport sse linear https://mcp.linear.app/sse
   # Authenticate with /mcp command
   ```

2. **Install Azure CLI:**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install azure-cli
   
   # Linux
   curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
   
   # Login to Azure
   az login
   ```

3. **Create Agents:**
   ```bash
   # Use /agents command to create each agent with the configurations above
   /agents
   ```

4. **Create Slash Command:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   # Add the build-todo-app.md content above
   ```

5. **Run Comparison:**
   - **Branch 1:** Use the prompt directly: `@todo-app-prompt.md`
   - **Branch 2:** Use the orchestrated command: `/build-todo-app`

The difference in output quality, completeness, and professionalism will be immediately apparent.
